# Translation Guidelines

## Overview

These guidelines ensure consistent, high-quality translations across all target languages.

## General Rules

1. **Markup Preservation**
   - Don't translate text within [] or {} brackets
   - Example: "{[REWARD]} coins" â†’ "{[REWARD]} monedas"

2. **Format Consistency**
   - Maintain case (uppercase/lowercase)
   - Preserve punctuation
   - Keep newlines (represented as \\n)

3. **Length Constraints**
   - Translations should ideally not be longer than source text
   - Consider UI space limitations

4. **Term Base Usage**
   - Always use approved translations from the term base
   - Report any missing terms that should be added

## Context Awareness

1. **Game Context**
   - Maintain casual, fun tone appropriate for mobile games
   - Consider the target audience
   - Use gaming terminology consistently

2. **UI Context**
   - Consider where the text appears (buttons, menus, dialogs)
   - Ensure translations fit UI elements
   - Maintain consistent style within similar UI elements

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### All Languages
- Maintain appropriate formality level
- Use standard language variants
- Follow target language punctuation rules

### Special Cases
1. **Numbers and Units**
   - Follow local formatting conventions
   - Use appropriate measurement units

2. **Date and Time**
   - Use local date formats
   - Follow 12/24-hour conventions

## Quality Checks

Your translations will be automatically checked for:
1. Term base compliance
2. Format preservation
3. Character limits
4. Markup integrity

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**
   - Use term base for standard translations
   - Maintain consistent style throughout

2. **Localization**
   - Adapt cultural references appropriately
   - Consider local gaming terminology

3. **Clarity**
   - Keep translations clear and concise
   - Avoid ambiguity

## Common Issues to Avoid

1. **Technical**
   - Modifying markup tags
   - Changing variable placeholders
   - Breaking newline conventions

2. **Style**
   - Inconsistent terminology
   - Overly literal translations
   - Inappropriate formality level

## Term Base Management

1. **Using Terms**
   - Always check term base before translating
   - Use exact matches for established terms

2. **Suggesting New Terms**
   - Identify game-specific terminology
   - Note terms needing consistent translation
   - Provide context and usage examples
